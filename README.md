My entry for Ludum Dare 26 (Minimalism)


# I'm in

I'm signing up for my first Ludum Dare.

To make it interesting, I've decided to do the whole thing using just my iPad!

I'll be using Javascript with these tools:

<ul>
<li>Library: <a href="http://jawsjs.com">JawsJs</a></li>
<li>IDE: <a href="http://www.textasticapp.com/">Textastic</a></li>
<li>Graphics: <a href="http://terriblegames.com/spriteSomething/">Sprite Something</a></li>
<li>Sound: <a href="http://www.warmplace.ru/soft/pixitracker/">PixiTracker</a></li>
</ul>

I also might use a simple touch-based control pad I made a while ago, code for which is <a href="https://github.com/MalphasWats/Quint">on GitHub</a>

I've set my iPad up to mirror to my iMac so I can take screenshots for a time lapse that I'll post at the end!


# Minimalism
"The Minimalist" art crime story. Bryan is an Artist, he likes to keep his work simple, in fact, critics have hailed him as one of the greatest living Minimalists.

No longer a crime story. Bryan works as an Artist and must create works of minimalist art on demand, trying to make enough cash to live.


#Grrr,

I had my iMac set to require password after it went to sleep so I missed the first hour of work that I did!
